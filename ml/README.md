# ML System Documentation

## Overview

The LMS includes a machine learning system that provides student analytics and predictions. The system uses scikit-learn models to assess student risk levels and predict final grades.

## Features

### 1. Student Risk Assessment
- **Risk Levels**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- **Based on**: Average scores, submission rates, on-time submissions, participation
- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier

### 2. Grade Prediction
- **Predicts**: Final letter grades (A+ through F)
- **Confidence Score**: Model confidence in prediction
- **Model**: Gradient Boosting Regressor

### 3. Performance Analytics
- **Trend Analysis**: Improving, Stable, Declining
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Study tips based on performance patterns
- **Feature Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of performance metrics

## Model Training

### Automatic Training
Models are pre-trained with synthetic data and ready to use.

### Manual Retraining
```bash
# Retrain models with default 2000 samples
python manage.py train_ml_models

# Retrain with specific number of samples
python manage.py train_ml_models --samples 5000
```

### Training Data Features
1. **avg_score**: Average assignment score percentage
2. **submission_rate**: Percentage of assignments submitted
3. **on_time_rate**: Percentage of on-time submissions
4. **participation**: Calculated participation score
5. **assignment_count**: Total number of assignments
6. **days_since_last**: Days since last submission

## Integration

### In Views
```python
from ml.predictions import get_student_analytics

# Get complete analytics for a student
analytics = get_student_analytics(user, classroom)

# Access results
risk_level = analytics['risk_analysis']['risk_level']
predicted_grade = analytics['grade_analysis']['predicted_grade']
trend = analytics['performance_trend']
```

### Model Files
- `ml/models/risk_model.pkl` - Risk assessment model
- `ml/models/risk_scaler.pkl` - Feature scaler for risk model
- `ml/models/grade_model.pkl` - Grade prediction model
- `ml/models/grade_scaler.pkl` - Feature scaler for grade model

## Testing

```bash
# Test ML system functionality
python ml/test_ml.py
```

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Graceful fallback when models aren't available
- Default predictions when ML fails
- Detailed error logging for debugging

## Performance

- **Risk Model Accuracy**: Typically 85-90%
- **Grade Model RÂ²**: Typically 0.75-0.85
- **Prediction Time**: < 100ms per student
- **Memory Usage**: ~50MB for loaded models
